searching fora  file you can use : grep 'string' <file>

  but if we want to search patterns and such, we can use:

[abc] - matches a, b, and c
[abc]zz - matches azz, bzz, czz
[a-c]zz - same as above

[a-cx-z]zz - matches azz, bzz, czz, xzz, yzz, zzz

file[1-3] matches file1, file2, file3

a.c - matches aac, abc, a0c, e!c and so forth
